"""CJK captions must lose the inter-word space in every composition.

PR #507 gave `CaptionOverlay` a `wordSeparator` prop, but it defaulted to
`" "` and only `TalkingHead` forwarded it. `Explainer` and `CinematicRenderer`
never passed it, so captions there kept a space between every token — the
defect #507 set out to fix, still live on the two main composition paths.

The separator is now decided per adjacent pair when the prop is unset, so a
script boundary keeps its space ("使用 OpenMontage 製作的影片") while two CJK
tokens are glued. An explicit `wordSeparator` still overrides.

There is no JS test runner in this repo, so the wiring is asserted against the
source the way test_remotion_video_transition_contract.py does. The character
ranges are extracted and exercised for real, since a range table is exactly
the kind of thing that looks right and is not.
